VanillaPlus modpack for 1.20.1 for the Anki 3 server. It comes with fun things such as:

- Big machines! (Create with addons)
- Fun foods (Farmers delight)
- Radical computers (ComputerCraft)
- Immersive maps (Map Atlases)
- Pretty building blocks (Chipped)
- Gorgeous landscapes (Terralith, Tectonic & lots of fun structures)
- Good performance (Sodium & friends)

The vision for this modpack is to be close to vanilla but enhanced with Create, ComputerCraft and some fun extra additions. This is then complemented with exiting new terrain that uses mostly vanilla blocks.
